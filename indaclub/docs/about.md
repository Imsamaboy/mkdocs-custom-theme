# 💡 About IndaClub

IndaClub started as a simple idea:  
**make discovering experiences as easy as scrolling your feed**.

Behind the scenes, it’s powered by:
- **Kotlin + Spring Boot** backend  
- **PostgreSQL** for structured data  
- **AWS S3** for media  
- **PostgreSQL full-text search** for lightning-fast discovery  
- **CI/CD via GitHub Actions** for smooth deployments
